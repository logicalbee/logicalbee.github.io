{:toc}</li></ul><h3 id=what-is-affiliate-marketing>What is Affiliate Marketing?</h3><p>Affiliate marketing basically means:
You promote a product/service using your own unique affiliate link and whenever a sale is made via that link you will get a commission for each sale.</p><p>Example:
Rama is selling an online Product for $100 with a 50% affiliate commission.
You promote John’s course with your own affiliate link and whenever a sale is made via your link, you will get a 50% commission i.e $50 per sale.</p><p>Why Affiliate Marketing?</p><ul><li>Easy to get started</li><li>Turn your hobby/passion into business</li><li>No experience required</li><li>You don&rsquo;t need to have your own product</li><li>Online passive income</li><li>Highly scalable</li></ul><h3 id=step-1-choose-a-best-profitable-niche>STEP 1: Choose a Best Profitable Niche</h3><p><img src=/images/niche.png alt=find-niche></p><p>The first step when getting started with affiliate marketing is to settle on a distinct segment .
When choosing your niche make sure it has a huge demand and high profit margins.
Also, your niche should be something that you are interested in or are passionate about. Many people make the mistake of choosing a niche just because of high profit margins but they don’t personally enjoy it.
Remember the goal here is to do what you love and to also make money while doing it.</p><h3 id=step-2-choose-an-excellent-product-to-promote>STEP 2: Choose an excellent product to promote</h3><p><img src=/images/find.jpg alt=find-Product></p><p>The second step is to find an excellent product to promote.
The product that you are promoting should be something that your niche/audience will be interested in.
Example:
If you are in the “Dog Training” niche, you should promote a “How to train your dog - online course/ebook” instead of promoting “beauty products”.</p><h3 id=step-3-choose-a-traffic-sourceplatform>STEP 3: Choose a traffic source/platform</h3><p><img src=/images/social.jpg alt=Choose-traffic></p><p>The third step is to choose a traffic source to promote your Product & bring people to your affiliate links.
It doesn’t matter how good the product is, if people do not see it. You need a constant stream of targeted people seeing your product/offer.
This is how you make sales & affiliate commissions.</p><blockquote><p>More traffic = more sales = Earn more money</p></blockquote><p>There are multiple traffic sources and platforms to choose from, example: Facebook, Instagram, Youtube etc.</p><p>Other than you can start a blog and write articles etc.</p><p>As a beginner you should stick to 1 traffic source until you are generating at least 1 sale per day.</p><p>After this, if required you can branch out into other traffic sources/platforms.</p><h3 id=step-4-add-value--build-your-brand>STEP 4: Add value & build your brand</h3><p><img src=/images/value.jpg alt=Brand-value></p><p>The fourth step is to add value and build your brand.</p><p>You can do this by using a process called “Content Marketing”. Content marketing basically means that you create free content that your niche/audience is interested in.</p><p>Example: If you are in the “Traveling” niche, you can make free videos on Youtube about “Bast places we can visit without visa” etc.</p><p>By adding value and providing free content to your audience, you are actually building trust and a loyal following of engaged fans.</p><p>The more your audience relate to and trust you, the higher chance that they will buy a product/service that you recommend i.e your affiliate product.</p><h3 id=step-5-build-an-automated-sales-funnel>STEP 5: Build an automated sales funnel</h3><p><img src=/images/fanal.jpg alt=Brand-fanal></p><p>The fifth step is to build an automated sales funnel which is capable of making you money while you sleep.</p><p>An automated sales funnel basically nurtures leads and turns them into sales.
Remember?</p><blockquote><p>More sales = more commissions = more money</p></blockquote><p>There are 3 main things you will need to build an automated sales funnel:</p><ul><li><p>OptIn/Squeeze page:
This is a single page which is highly focused on only 1 action i.e you want to convert visitors into leads (collect email addresses).</p></li><li><p>Email marketing platform:
This is a software (free & paid options available) that is used to build and save a list of all the email addresses you have collected using the optin page.</p></li><li><p>Email sales funnel/automation:
W​ithin your email marketing platform, you will have an option to create and setup automated email sequences that are designed to nurture your leads and convert them into sales.</p></li></ul><p>And those are The 5 Steps To Making Money With Affiliate Marketing.</p><div class=advert-inline><ins class=adsbygoogle style=display:block data-ad-client=ca-pub-6155459918319745 data-ad-slot=1336835070 data-ad-format=auto data-full-width-responsive=true></ins><script>(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});</script></div></div></section><footer><p>&copy; 2020 - 2022</p></footer></main></body></html>
