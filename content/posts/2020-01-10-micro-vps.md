### How to set up a free micro VPS on Google Cloud Platform | Always Free!
 
### Introduction

While there are a great deal of suppliers that offer littler VPS you can test for nothing for a specific time extend, there are very few that are for all time free. This article will concentrate on setting up a f1-small scale VPS on Google Cloud Platform that is promoted as "Always free!". Google offers an exceptionally wide scope of conceivable VPS designs and as opposed to different suppliers, the complementary plan is fairly covered up in all the accessible choices. This article will control you through the arrangement procedure bit by bit.

The f1-micro VPS is part of Google’s “always free” products. If the 12 month test period has ended or if you used up all the credit of your voucher, you will not be able to use these free products anymore. In this case, you will have to upgrade your account, enabling Google to charge your credit card. However, the f1-micro VPS will still be free. Be aware that you might be credited in this case if you use more than the free network egress traffic of 1 GB per month (excluding Australia and China).

Click on Change in the Boot disk section. Optionally you can change the pre-installed operating system you want to use. More importantly, you can increase the amount of persistent disk space in this dialog. Increase the value to 30 (included in the “always free” package) and leave the dialog using the Select button.
