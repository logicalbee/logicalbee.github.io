### STEP 1: Choose a Best Profitable Niche

![find-niche](/images/niche.png)

The first step when getting started with affiliate marketing is to settle on a distinct segment .
When choosing your niche make sure it has a huge demand and high-profit margins.
Also, your niche should be something that you are interested in or are passionate about. Many people make the mistake of choosing a niche just because of high-profit margins but they don’t personally enjoy it.
Remember the goal here is to do what you love and to also make money while doing it.

### STEP 2: Choose Best Suitable blog name

Choosing the best suitable domain name is not a big deal for bloggers. If you decided your domain name so you can skip this part.
If you haven’t chosen your domain name till now –
When I was started my blogging journey, I don’t know how to choose a premium domain for my blog, and that’s why I wasted 10+ domains randomly.
Make sure, that you don’t make a mistake like me?
If Yes! Here are four tips which help you to find the best suitable name for your dream domain

- Keep it Short & Simple
- Use Keyword
- Don’t Use Numbers
- Always Use TLD Extension

Note: Which blogging platform should you choose
There are multiple ways to create a blog

1. Free Source
2. Paid Source

If you are a beginner you can try out with free sources until you get some grip in blogging.
here I’m going to mention some links you can checkout

- [blogspot.com](https://www.blogspot.com)
- [wordpress.com](https://www.wordpress.com)

If you are a pro blogger and if you want to earn some money from your content, I strongly recommended you go with WordPress.

#### Why?

Because in free platforms, you get everything to customize your blog, but WordPress gives you the freedom to customize your blog as you want.
In WordPress, you have many plugins and themes by which you can use to make your blog Pro and better than before.
So I think you can get an idea of why WordPress is good,
Let’s dive in and let me tell you to steps create your blog.


### STEP 3: Get Your Blog Online

To get your blog up and running you need to have a cloud service to serve the content to users.

A Cloud hosting provider stores all of the blog related files and delivers them to the user when they type in your blog URL on the search engine.

In order to get your blog online, There are multiple companies providing hosting services with bunch of features.
