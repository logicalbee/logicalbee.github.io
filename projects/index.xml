Since then, I have upgraded the setup and the hardware as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The RPi had 8GB of RAM, but it was not very stable for a home server. By stability, I mean: stable storage, faster RAM, faster processor, more ports, etc Since starting with the home server with RPi, I wanted to have some regularly used services rather than just hosting whatever I like. For example, in the last post, I said I hosted memos for note-taking, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t work. I didn&amp;rsquo;t see myself using it very much (not at all, actually). I understood that this is kind of a trial-and-error method, but I need to have a few services that I actually use regularly.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
