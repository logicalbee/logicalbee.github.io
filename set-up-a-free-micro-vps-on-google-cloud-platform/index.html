This article will concentrate on setting up a f1-small scale VPS on Google Cloud Platform that is promoted as &ldquo;Always free!". Google offers an exceptionally wide scope of conceivable VPS designs and as opposed to different suppliers, the complementary plan is fairly covered up in all the accessible choices. This article will control you through the arrangement procedure bit by bit.</p><p><img src=/images/m1.png alt="free f1-micro configuration"></p><p>The f1-micro VPS is part of Google’s “always free” products. If the 12 month test period has ended or if you used up all the credit of your voucher, you will not be able to use these free products anymore. In this case, you will have to upgrade your account, enabling Google to charge your credit card. However, the f1-micro VPS will still be free. Be aware that you might be credited in this case if you use more than the free network egress traffic of 1 GB per month (excluding Australia and China).</p><p></p><h3 id=set-up-an-f1-micro-instance>Set up an f1-micro instance</h3><p>Setting up an f1-micro VPS as shown in this article will not generate any cost for you, it could happen that due to some.</p><p>We cannot take responsibility for any cost that might be generated on your account, especially when exceeding the allowed traffic volume of 1 GB per month.
